### Creation and preparation of the virtual private server (VPS)

# Generating SSH keys to access the vps safely
=> Usage :  SSH protocol can establish secure connection with your system and your repairs
=> Generate Key : 
1- ssh-keygen
2- choose the file name and change the path if you need "/Users/index/.ssh/my_vps_root", change "my_vps_root" name 
3- set a password for your key if you need

# Create a vps in digital ocean

# Connecting to vps via ssh 
- shh root@vpsIP -i "/Users/index/.ssh/my_vps_root"

# Improving the connection via vps
1- Go to the .ssh folder "/Users/index/.ssh"
2- Create config file without ext "config" maybe the file is exist
3- Add this configuration 
Host my_vps_root
  HostName "vpsIP"
  User root
  IdentityFile "location for ssh key file" ex: "/Users/index/.ssh/my_vps_root"

# Keeping the connection active with VPS server
1- Open config file that we created in the prev step and add these two lines at 
the top of config file to be a global variables:
ServerAliveInterval 120
ServerAliveCountMax 3

# Resolving an existing domain to the vps server
1- Add domain to digital ocean (Network tab)
2- Add Nameservers Provider for digital ocean in goddady (ns1.digitalocean.com)
3- In digitalocean add these DNS records
A record => @
CNAME record => w w w => @ => 3600

### Using and understanding some essential commands and tasks on a VPS

# How to explore and navigate paths in the vps
"ls" => showing unhidden files
"ls -la" or "ll" => showing hidden and unhidden files
"ll + path " ex: "ll .ssh" => showing all files in .ssh folder
"cd - " => going to the prev location


# File managment (create, delete, move, copy and read)
"touch" => create file 
"nano" => create file and open it in the editor
"cat + file name" => show the content inside the file
"mv + file path + destination path" => move file to specific path. ex:  "mv text.txt /" will move text.txt to the root 
"mv + currentName + newName" => rename file. ex: "mv text.txt newText.txt"
"cp + fileNameWantToCopy + nameOfTheCopy" => take a copy from exiting file. ex: "cp text.txt text3.txt"
"rm + file name" => remove a file

# Directory managmen (create, delete, move, copy and read)
"mkdir + dir name" => create a directory
"cp -r + dirWantToCopy + CopyDir" => take a opy from existing directory to new or other existing dir
"mv + dirWeWantToMove + destinationDir" => move directory to other existing or new directory
"rm -r + dir names" => remove one or more directorys
