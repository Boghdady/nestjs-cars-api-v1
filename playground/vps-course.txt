### Creation and preparation of the virtual private server (VPS)

# Generating SSH keys to access the vps safely
=> Usage :  SSH protocol can establish secure connection with your system and your repairs
=> Generate Key : 
1- ssh-keygen
2- choose the file name and change the path if you need "/Users/index/.ssh/my_vps_root", change "my_vps_root" name 
3- set a password for your key if you need

# Create a vps in digital ocean

# Connecting to vps via ssh 
- shh root@vpsIP -i "/Users/index/.ssh/my_vps_root"

# Improving the connection via vps
1- Go to the .ssh folder "/Users/index/.ssh"
2- Create config file without ext "config" maybe the file is exist
3- Add this configuration 
Host my_vps_root
  HostName "vpsIP"
  User root
  IdentityFile "location for ssh key file" ex: "/Users/index/.ssh/my_vps_root"
4- Now you ca access your vps using "ssh my_vps_root"

# Keeping the connection active with VPS server
1- Open config file that we created in the prev step and add these two lines at 
the top of config file to be a global variables:
ServerAliveInterval 120
ServerAliveCountMax 3

# Resolving an existing domain to the vps server
1- Add domain to digital ocean (Network tab)
2- Add Nameservers Provider for digital ocean in goddady (ns1.digitalocean.com)
3- In digitalocean add these DNS records
A record => @
CNAME record => w w w => @ => 3600

### Using and understanding some essential commands and tasks on a VPS

# How to explore and navigate paths in the vps
"ls" => showing unhidden files
"ls -la" or "ll" => showing hidden and unhidden files
"ll + path " ex: "ll .ssh" => showing all files in .ssh folder
"cd - " => going to the prev location


# File managment (create, delete, move, copy and read)
"touch" => create file 
"nano" => create file and open it in the editor
"cat + file name" => show the content inside the file
"mv + file path + destination path" => move file to specific path. ex:  "mv text.txt /" will move text.txt to the root 
"mv + currentName + newName" => rename file. ex: "mv text.txt newText.txt"
"cp + fileNameWantToCopy + nameOfTheCopy" => take a copy from exiting file. ex: "cp text.txt text3.txt"
"rm + file name" => remove a file

# Directory managmen (create, delete, move, copy and read)
"mkdir + dir name" => create a directory
"cp -r + dirWantToCopy + CopyDir" => take a opy from existing directory to new or other existing dir
"mv + dirWeWantToMove + destinationDir" => move directory to other existing or new directory
"rm -r + dir names" => remove one or more directorys

# Tricks to be agile on the command line with your vps
"clear" => clear the terminal
"control + r" => showing the history of the commands that i wrote it in the terminal

# Use apt to manage and upgrade the VPS packages
"apt --help" => show list of common commands that you can use
"apt update" => update the list of packages

# VPS services managment with the systemctl command
"systemcrl --help" => show list of common commands that you can use
"systemctl start + service name" =>  start the service
"systemctl restart + service name" => restart the service (stop and start the service)
"systemctl stop + service name" => stop the service
"systemctl status + service name" => showing the service status
"systemctl reload+  service name" => reload the configuration of the service (don't stop the service)

# How to restart the VPS server when required
"reboot" => this command will turn off and turn on your vps

# How to establish SSH connections from the vps
=> We want to connect our VPS to third part liberaries like github, gitlab, etc
1- Generate ssh key inside our VPS "ssh-keygen"
2- Set a password for your ssh key if you need
3- "ll .ssh/" => to show key files in your vps root (id_rsa & id_rsa.pub)
4- "eval $(ssh-agent -s)" Register the created ssh key with ssh agent to establish ssh connection directly
or using any packages like git, this key will use Automatically.
5- Associate created ssh agent with created ssh key "ssh-add .ssh/id_rsa"
6- Get the ssh public key that we created and add them to github "cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub"
7- Establish ssh connection with git for example "ssh -T git@github.com"

# Execute recurring tasks on the VPS using Cronjobs
Cronjob => means execute specific task in my VPS every specific time (minut, month , year , etc)
- ex: Put current date & time into time.txt file every single minut
1- open crontab to add this job. "crontab -e"
2- choose nano editor to edit the file
3- add this job in the file. "* * * * * date >> /root/time.txt"
Note : use this website to know how to determine time (https://crontab.guru/)

- Stop the corn job:
1- open crontab to stop this job. "crontab -e"  
2- remove or comment the job in corntab file
